<p>The <b>World Wide Web</b> is comprised of billions of HTML files. It contains many other kinds of files too like pdfs and word documents.</p>
<p> The major pieces of the web are you, your computer/browser, the internet, and servers. Servers are just computers and they use HTTP which is just a protocol it uses to communicate with your browser.
</p>
<p>
  <b>HTTP</b> (HyperText Markup Language ) is The main protocol of the web.
  <br>
  <b>Servers</b> are computers that host the files that make up the web.
  <br> The <b>Internet</b> is the world’s largest computer network.
  <br> A <b>browser</b> is a program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web.
</p>

<b><em>HTML Tags</b></em>
<p>
  <b>b</b> tag makes text <b>Bold</b>
  <br>
  <b>em</b> tag makes text <em>Italic</em>
  <br>

  <p>Sometimes tags come with attributes. For example the anchor tag "a" has an href attribute.
    <br> This creates a
    <a href=”www.reddit.com”>link</a>. (In this case the link is to www.reddit.com)
  </p>

  The <b>img</b> tag has two attributes called <b>src</b> and <b>alt</b> which allows you to add images.
  <br> The <b>src</b> attribute is obviously the source file for the image while <b>alt</b> provivides a description of the image or some helpful comment.
  <br>
  <br> Ex)<img src=”noadults.jpeg” alt=”ALTtag”>
  <br>
  <br> Important note
  <br>
  <em>img tags don’t have a closing tag. The alt attribute provides a message when the link fails.</em>

  <b>br</b> tag provides a line break
  <em>Like the <b>img</b> tag it is a void tag, doesn’t require a closing tag.</em>
  <p>
    <b>p</b> is a paragraph tag and is not a void tag. This tag is what’s known as a block element.
  </p>

  The following tags are container elements which simply contain stuff
  <br> span - inline element
  <br> div - block element
  <p>
    <b>Inline</b> elements are just text while <b>block</b> elements create a dimensional space which can later be configured. Block elements draw a an invisible box around the text
